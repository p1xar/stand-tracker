# Stand Tracker - an Apple Watch fitness tracking app
This app tracks your standing sessions in front of the computer, accurately estimating the calories you burn during that time.
The app was created because Apple Watch lacks native support for long standing sessions. It tracks standing as if it were sitting, leading to inaccurate calorie calculations. In reality, the Metabolic Equivalent of Task (MET) is higher when standing—approximately 1.8 compared to 1.3 for sitting—resulting in underestimated calorie burn.
